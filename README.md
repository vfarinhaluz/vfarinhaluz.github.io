# Virtual Economics

## Welcome

`virtual-econ.info` is intended to store various virtual conferences, seminars, talks, and resources while many of us are sequestered at home. Hat tip to [Luke Stein](https://twitter.com/lukestein) for the initial resources and the suggestion to build the website.

## How to contribute

You can contribute information to this website by opening a pull request on GitHub repository for [this page](https://github.com/cpfiffer/virtual-econ.info) to edit any of the various webpages you see here. Each page has its own handy "Edit me" button if you want to quickly add something to a list.
